gen_ark12.py -- turn Ark Pixel Font's 12px glyph PNGs into the C table in
fonts/ark12/ark12.h.

Why this exists at all, and why its output is committed while font8x8's is
not: Ark Pixel does not ship a single header, or even a single font file
in its source tree. It ships one PNG per glyph -- tens of thousands of
them -- and builds the .otf/.bdf at release time. cmake/vendored.cmake's
model of "fetch one pinned file and check its SHA256" does not survive
that, and fetching a 17 MB repository archive on every fresh configure to
extract twenty thousand files from it is worse than committing the output.

So: this script is run by hand, rarely (only when bumping ARK_COMMIT), and
its output goes into git. The pin below is what makes that honest -- the
header records the commit it came from, so it can be regenerated and
diffed byte for byte by anyone who doubts it.

Usage:
    ./tools/gen_ark12.py                     # downloads the pinned archive
    ./tools/gen_ark12.py --src path/to/repo  # uses a checkout you have

Requires only the standard library. The PNGs are tiny RGBA images, so the
decoder here is a complete but deliberately unclever implementation of the
five PNG filter types rather than a Pillow dependency.

# The subset. Two widths coexist here, not one: Ark ships glyphs at this
# pixel size in three cuts -- "monospaced" (6x12, one cell), "common"
# (12x12, one cell doubled -- CJK-shaped scripts and the fullwidth forms
# of a few Latin-1 symbols) and "proportional" (variable width AND
# variable height, which is a different rendering model than this file
# has and is not what RANGES below draws from). A range only belongs here
# if every codepoint in it resolves to one of the first two.
#
# Cyrillic is in RANGES now and was not at 10px. The reason is entirely
# about which cuts exist at which size: at 10px Cyrillic is shipped only
# in the "proportional" cut -- 16 rows tall with per-glyph ascenders and
# descenders, spanning rows 2..13, which no 10-row window can crop without
# clipping real letters (measured: the best-placed window still clips 25
# of 153 glyphs). At 12px there is a genuine monospaced Cyrillic cut at
# the same 6x12 cell as Latin, so it drops in with no special handling at
# all. Nothing clever happened here; the data simply exists at this size
# and did not at the last one.
#
# Hangul is still out, and for an unchanged reason: the Compatibility Jamo
# block (individual letters) exists, but Hangul Syllables -- the composed
# characters real Korean text is written in -- has no glyphs at this size
# either. Jamo alone cannot render a Korean title; Unicode's algorithmic
# Hangul composition would have to run on top of glyphs this font does not
# have, so Korean stays out rather than shipping half of it.
#
# What *is* available clean, checked against the archive: Hiragana and
# Katakana (93 + 96 codepoints, both entirely 12x12 in the "common" cut),
# CJK Symbols and Punctuation (the fullwidth quote marks and brackets
# Japanese and Chinese titles actually use), and -- the reason this size
# was worth the move -- 18,299 unique CJK Unified Ideograph codepoints,
# against 1,076 at 10px. That is effectively the whole block rather than a
# subset, so a Chinese or Japanese title is no longer a coin flip on
# whether its particular characters happen to be drawn.
#
# "Effectively" and not "entirely": Ark is hand-drawn and crowd-
# contributed, and a few codepoints simply have no glyph at any size --
# U+8B77 and U+90CE among them, both ordinary characters in Japanese
# names. They come out of glyph_for() as a notdef box, which is the
# correct outcome and not a bug in this script; there is nothing to
# generate. Expect a small number of boxes in CJK text rather than none.
#
# Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms (FF00-FFEF) is in RANGES because gfx.c's
# cp_is_wide() already treats that block as fullwidth, and a block the
# renderer reserves double-width space for but the table has no glyphs
# for is the worst of both: a double-wide notdef box where a fullwidth
# parenthesis belongs. Japanese and Chinese taggers use these constantly
# -- a title with (2017) in fullwidth parens is completely ordinary --
# so the block was a real omission rather than a nicety, caught by
# rendering a sampler sheet and seeing the boxes.
#
# That coverage is not free: see the size report emit() prints. The table
# is roughly 545 KB against a 3 MB app partition. It is affordable, it is
# the single largest thing in the binary, and it is the first thing to
# trim if that ever stops being true -- dropping (0x4E00, 0x9FFF) alone
# takes it to about 62 KB while keeping every Latin, Cyrillic, kana and
# fullwidth-punctuation glyph. Note that 62 and not something nearer 20:
# Extension A is 1,480 codepoints of its own and stays behind, so cutting
# the main block is most but not all of the saving.
#
# Latin Extended-B and Latin Extended Additional (Vietnamese) are still
# excluded on the original grounds -- a long tail this player is unlikely
# to meet on an SD card. Add the range here and rerun if that turns out to
# be wrong.

# 12px, not the 10px this started at. Ark ships three sizes -- 10, 12 and
# 16 -- and they are not the same font at three scales; they are three
# separately drawn sets with very different coverage, because this is a
# hand-drawn crowd-contributed font and contributors did not spread evenly
# across sizes. Counted from the archive rather than assumed:
#
#                        10px        12px        16px
#   CJK Unified          1076       18299          97
#   Cyrillic (mono)         0         151         151
#   Hiragana/Katakana   93/96       93/96       93/96
#
# 12px is simply where this font is finished. It is the only size with a
# monospaced Cyrillic cut at the same fixed cell as Latin (10px has only
# a variable-height "proportional" cut, which is a different rendering
# model and was why Cyrillic was excluded before), and its CJK coverage is
# effectively the whole block rather than a curated subset. 16px regresses
# hard on CJK -- 97 codepoints -- so it buys resolution and loses the
# script that motivated the exercise.
#
# There is a display argument on top of the coverage one. The panel is
# 720x1280 on 5", about 294 PPI, and CLAUDE.md's "Sizes are set for 294
# PPI" section scales everything up to compensate. Scaling up a 10px glyph
# by 4 gives 40px of very blocky letterform; a 12px glyph by 3 gives 36px
# with more drawn detail underneath and a smaller scale multiplier, so the
# blocks are 3x3 rather than 4x4. Same physical size, more fidelity --
# which is the whole point of having pixels this small.
