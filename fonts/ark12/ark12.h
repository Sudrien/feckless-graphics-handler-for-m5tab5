 *
 * Every glyph is 12 rows tall and either 6px (Latin and its
 * relatives -- one cell) or 12px (CJK-adjacent scripts and fullwidth forms -- two cells, the
 * same shape a CJK terminal font calls fullwidth) wide. ark12_glyph()
 * hands back a glyph as 12 rows, each one value with bit 0 leftmost --
 * the shape gfx.c draws from.
 *
 * STORED AS TILES (5247). A full-width glyph is four 6x6 tiles (top
 * left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) and a half-width one two
 * (top, bottom). Across the font 81712 tiles are only 33775
 * distinct -- blank corners, shared radicals, repeated strokes -- so each
 * distinct tile is stored once, 36 bits packed end to end in
 * ark12_tiles, and a glyph is its tiles' numbers in ark12_tix. The
 * codepoints are runs of consecutive glyphs of one width (ark12_runs),
 * so there is no table per glyph at all: a glyph's tile numbers start
 * at its run's `tix` plus its place in the run times its tile count.
 * 341748 bytes, where one uint16_t row per scanline and a codepoint and
 * a width per glyph took 559035.
